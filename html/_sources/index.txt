StealthRelay Documentation
==========================

StealthRelay is a simple message relay that extracts
an encrypted StealthText transaction from a local,
designated mailbox. It then dispatches the encrypted transaction
to the StealthCoin wallet where it is decrypted and
broadcast to the StealthCoin Tor network.


These instructions demonstrate how to set up a
completely automated StealthText pipeline with
a google voice number, the Thunderbird email program
enabled with FiltaQuilla, and StealthRelay. All of
these tools and services are completely free.


FAQ
---

**Can I use a different SMS forwarding service
from google voice or a different email program
from Thunderbird?**

Not at the moment. The email must be in
a specific format created by gmail and saved
in a specific format used by Thunderbird.
In the future, we may support other popular services and
clients upon request.


**What if I already have an email program.**

Thunderbird can run alongside other email
programs. You may want to create a unique
gmail account just for your StealthText
pipeline.


**Why does making a StealthText pipleine require
so many steps?**

All modern communication
requires pipelines that themselves took
many steps to create. StealthText is a brand new
service, so no pipelines are presently in place.
The situation is different for other services like
email and www. These services have been around
for decades and their pipelines are completely
established, with little effort required from end users in
most cases. Of course, I remember days in the
1990s when it would take half a day and a call to the
IT department to set up a POP email client!
Welcome to the cutting edge of anonymous transactions.


Installation
------------

Download StealthRelay at
https://github.com/StealthSend/StealthRelay/Builds/.

In Windows, drag the StealthRelay program
folder to your chosen location.
In Linux, save the executable in ~/bin, /usr/local/bin,
or similar. 
In OS X (not available yet),
open the disk image file drag the StealthRelay program to 
the Applications folder of your hard drive.

.. IMPORTANT::

   Note where you put the StealthRelay program.
Google Voice Number
-------------------

For people in the US, complete instructions for creating a google
voice number are here:

StealthCoin Configuration
-------------------------

To use StealthRelay, you need to adjust your "StealthCoin.conf" file. You need
to configure a couple of settings, modified for your set up. Be sure to choose
a ``stealthsecret`` of at least 20 random characters. You do
not need to memorize this secret. Choose a
``stealthpin`` that you can memorize but is hard to guess. A
``stealthpin`` may be a string of any characters and as long as you
can memorize (you may have characters other than numbers).
The ``stealthsecret`` will be entered into the settings of the
StealthText Android application. You need to set ``server=1``
and ``daemon=1`` as well as ``rpcuser`` and ``rpcpassword``.

The following is an example "StealthCoin.conf" file that can be
used with StealthText::

    rpcpassword=32JFGpNLpKwQ8nWDz353L4iDwesnTt3OgOoG81wo
    rpcuser=xstrpc
    server=1
    daemon=1
    stealthsecret=XAI81pM0H81OGaeCQuXmXA7nP
    stealthpin=506$Saturn$effect$wife$dance$867


.. WARNING::

   Don't use the above password, secret, or pin!
   They are just examples.
   You may generate a memorable and strong ``stealthpin`` at
   https://www.xkpasswd.net/c/index.cgi


You will not only want to have the StealthCoin Qt (or daemon)
running, but you will also want to have the daemon available
to accept the RPC (remote procedure calls) on behalf of the wallet.
The daemon does not need to be running if the Qt is already running,
but it gets launched by the relay every time an email comes in.
Links to daemons for Linux, Windows, and Mac (not yet available)
are on the bitcointalk forum OP
(https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=681725.0), and on the StealthCoin
website (https://stealth-coin.com/). Remember the place where
you download the daemon as you will add that daemon
to an email filter in the instructions below. Make sure
you get the right daemon for your OS.


Email Client
------------

You will need an email client that can (1) filter certain messages
to a designated mailbox and (2) launch a specific program upon 
receipt of certain messages. The Thunderbird
<https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/Thunderbird/> email program
is free and can do both, if enabled with the FiltaQuilla addon.

After downloading and installing Thunderbird, navigate to the menu
selection *File -> New -> Existing Mail Account*, to set up
your gmail account. Then, navigate to the menu selection
*Tools -> Add-ons* and install the FiltaQuilla addon.
In the preferences for the FiltaQuilla addon, ensure that
the option "Run File" is selected, under the "Filter Actions"
tab of the preference pane.

In Thunderbird, create a folder in "Local Folders" called "StealthRelay".

Use your mobile device to send your google voice number an SMS message.
Then, go to you gmail inbox and find the email message corresponding
to this SMS message. Note the "From:" address, which will look something
like the following::

    15555555555.15555551212.uniquestring@txt.voice.google.com

This address should be used as the "confirm_address" in the
StealthRelay configuration file, as described
below.

In Thunderbird, create a filter by navigating to the menu
item "Tools -> Message Filters". The filter will be for the gmail
account linked to your google voice number. Call the filter "StealthText".
Select "Match all of the following".
Add a "From"/"is" conditional for the @txt.voice.google.com email
above. Then, to the same filter, add a "Body"/"contains" conditional
for a client ID. For this example, the client ID will be "w00t".

.. image:: images/filter.png

Perform two actions with the filter. First "Move Message to" the
"StealthRelay on Local Folders". Second "Run File" for the StealthRelay
program.

This filter will now run StealthRelay any time an email arrives
from your mobile device and has the client identifier in it
(w00t). When you fill your preferences in the StealthText Android
application, ensure to enter the client ID exactly as it is
in this filter.


Configuration
-------------

Once installed, it is necessary to configure StealthRelay.
In your home folder, edit a plain text file called
".stealthrelay" (note the leading period). It should
have the following contents, edited as appropriate::

     daemon = /Users/username/bin/StealthCoind
     sender = yourgoogleaccount@gmail.com
     username = yourgoogleaccount
     password = googlepassword
     server = smtp.gmail.com:587
     confirm_address = 15555555555.15555551212.uniquestring@txt.voice.google.com
     success = May the force be with you.
     fail = I am your father.


The settings in ".stealthrelay" specify how the StealthRelay
program behaves.

- **daemon** - location of the StealthCoin wallet *daemon*
- **sender** - the google email account linked to google voice
- **username** - google email user name
- **password** - google email password
- **server** - google's mail server and port (no need to change)
- **confirm_address** - confirmation info is sent to this email address
- **success** - a message to indicate a successful transaction
- **fail** - a message to indicate a failed transaction

Another option, called **mail** allows you to specify the location
of the Thunderbird profile folder in case this folder is in
a non-standard location::

     mail = /Path/To/Thunderbird/Profiles

Be sure to save the ".stealthrelay" file or change its settings such
that you are the only person who can read it. It is best
to have a special gmail account just for StealthText
transactions because the config file requires you to
enter the gmail password as plain text.

The **confirm_address** can be found in the "From:" section of
an email created by sending an SMS message from your mobile device
to your google voice number.

StealthRelay will reply with a short message
that indicates success or failure of the transaction. You can choose
any messages you like for this purpose. After StealthRelay submits
a transaction to the wallet, it will attempt to send an email to
the **confirm_address** with the appropriate message. This address
will direct the contents of the email back to the device that
sent the StealthText transaction.


Ready!
------

If you have followed these instructions, you now have Thunderbird
configured to save new StealthText messages from a specific mobile
device into the local folder called "StealthRelay". Thunderbird will
then run "StealthRelay", which finds the new email, extracts
the encrypted transaction, and sends it to your StealthCoin wallet.
StealthRelay will await a confirmation from the wallet, and
send a message indicating success or failure of the transaction.
