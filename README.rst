StealthRelay Documentation
==========================

StealthRelay is a simple message relay that extracts
an encrypted StealthText transaction from a local,
designated mailbox. It then dispatches the encrypted transaction
to the StealthCoin wallet where it is decrypted and
broadcast to the StealthCoin Tor network.

The full docs are in the html directory at the
root of the StealthRelay repository at GitHub
(https://github.com/StealthSend/StealthRelay/).
